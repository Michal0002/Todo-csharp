#Todo App

The application allows users to plan and manage their tasks. It is a to-do list application that helps users keep track of their tasks and organize their daily activities.


The main view of the application is a table. This table can be filtered by task difficulty level and by whether tasks are completed or not.

On the main page, there are also CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) buttons. Users can edit current tasks, delete them, and add new ones.

When adding tasks, users can specify the task name, description, priority level, and deadline. This helps users to plan their tasks more effectively and ensure that all important details are included.
